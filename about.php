    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

  	<p class="text-left">Hi I'm Michelle, a front-end web developer and designer based in Vancouver, BC. My passion lies in bridging the gap between development and design with the goal of creating a great user experience. I thrive in creative environments where collaboration and innovation occur.</p>

  	<p class="text-left">Before pursuing web development full time, I worked in the customer service industry while simultaneously studying towards my Psychology degree at the University of British Columbia. Although I love abstract theories and big ideas, I needed a way to apply those ideas. I was stuck doing rigid work and I always knew that creativity is what drives me. I have always been fascinated with HTML ever since I was exposed to it through an online game as a child, but being able to turn a simple interest into a career is something I never dreamed about.</p>

    <p class="text-left">I am inspired by the thought process behind designs and am continuously learning new tools for the web to keep myself up to date. Designing for the web has brought out the pixel perfectionist in me and I love creating clean and sharp visuals. I believe that good design coupled with technology can enhance the content communicated. By placing the user at the heart of the design process while making it accessible for everyone, it can help change people's lives.</p> 

    <p class="text-left">When I'm not designing or coding, I enjoy taking photos, listening to music, and going on food adventures.</p>
