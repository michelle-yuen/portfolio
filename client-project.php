  	<h1>The Scope</h1>
  	<p class="text-left">The Dreadquarters is a hair salon specializing in dreadlocks and alternative hair. They have extensive experience in the creation and long term care of â€˜locks, for clients who travel from all over North America to their shop. Our client Kris, who is the owner of the shop, took over the business 4 years ago and created their current website on a WordPress theme with no web design experience. Unfortunately, the site was showing its age and even though it still functioned, it was outdated and overly complex to maintain.</p>
    <p class="text-left">Kris prides herself on The Dreadquarters' works and she wanted the galleries to be the main focus of the website so that clients could easily access the images. My team of 4 including myself contacted Kris through our Technical Web Designer program at BCIT to arrange an intial in-person meeting with her to better understand her needs and goals for the website. The project was completed in 1.5 months and served as one of our final projects.</p>

  	<h1>The Process</h1>
  	<p class="text-left"><strong>[ CONTENT, IA, WIREFRAMES ] </strong>After our initial meeting with Kris, we had a pretty good understanding of how the website would be laid out. Our client had provided us with a website that she liked for reference so we got an idea of what she liked. Her requirements were clear and direct, and we got straight to the wireframes but we really should have began with the information architecture in order to structure the content first. Fortunately, this did not have a major impact for us, but for a larger website it would have been costly.</p>

    <p class="text-left">In general, our client wanted to simplify the whole website by getting rid of the drop-down menu and having users be able to find most things without having to click around too many pages. She also had a blog that was not active and had broken images which she wanted to keep on the main menu, so we suggested to keep it but pick and choose the more relevant blog posts for us to reformat.</p>

  	<p class="text-left"><strong>[ DESIGN ] </strong>Due to the nature of the business and its fun clientele, Kris wanted to see bright colours and bolder uses of space on the website. We took inspiration from a business card that she showed us and used those shades of blue, pink and yellow for the logo redesign. We really liked the fonts she was using for her business card so we used the exact fonts and added the different colours to it. Since she wanted a splashier cover, we made the home page a solid blue background colour while the other pages simply had the word "Lockshop" coloured. We first created style tiles for our own reference, and then we made a mock-up on Photoshop to show Kris so that she would have an idea of what the design would look like. She did not have any objections to this so we proceeded to developing from there.</p>

  	<p class="text-left"><strong>[ FUNCTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ] </strong>For the development phase, we used WordPress where we created our own custom theme and worked on both the local and live environments. Our client wanted users to be able to click on a single service and have it show the gallery directly but she didn't want to use the Lightbox plugin on WordPress. To address this, we decided to use Masonry, a JavaScript grid layout library used on sites like Pinterest and Unsplash. We also figured out how to use Isotope JS for filtering the questions and answers on the FAQ page. During this development phase, I assisted with quite a bit of the PHP, HTML, and JavaScript. We got everything to function properly before moving on to the styling.</p>
    
    <p class="text-left"><strong>[ STYLING ] </strong>This stage took about 5 days to fully complete. Since we already had the wireframes and mock-ups for our site, we simply had to follow that, except for a few minor changes along the way.</p>

    <p class="text-left"><strong>[ SITE TESTING ] </strong>A group of BCIT students from another Technical Web Designer intake participated in our site testing where we got them to complete 8 tasks on our website. After conducting the site testing, we handed in a report summarizing the methods, results, and summary.</p>

    <p class="text-left"><strong>[ TUTORING & LAUNCHING ] </strong>We scheduled a day to meet with our client to show her the final site, migrate it, and demonstrated how to use and update the site with a short tutorial.</p>
    
    <h1>The Result</h1>
    <p class="text-left">We ended up producing a website that met the client's needs and business goals and she was very happy with it.</p><br>
